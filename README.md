>[!NOTE]
>This website is currently in beta and bugs will be a-plenty! Please report bugs if you find any!

>[!TIP]
>You can access the deployed website at [https://safecommutedev.web.app](https://safecommutedev.web.app) or follow the following instructions to build and deploy it yourself.

Clone the repo locally to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/mnkjoshi/SafeCommute
cd frontend
```

Then install all packages and necessary files with npm from the frontend folder:
```
npm install
```

Once all necessary files are downloaded, you can run the website yourself using npm:
```
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, to deploy and test it elsewhere you can:
```
npm run build
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You can repeat this process for the backend!

Feel free to leave any suggestions or improvements!
